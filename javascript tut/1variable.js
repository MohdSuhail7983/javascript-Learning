// In JavaScript, variables are containers for storing and managing data. They provide a way to name and reference values in your code.
//  A variable is declared using a keyword (such as var, let, or const) followed by a unique identifier (the variable name). Variables can hold 
//  various types of data, including numbers, strings, objects, functions, and more.
let num = 2+2;
console.log(num);
console.log(num+5);
console.log(num+10);
console.log(num+15);

// let username = 'Mohd's suhail'--->>> will not work because we used here single bracket in between 
// so can not used for whole string we should used double for the whole..
let username="Mohd Suhail"
console.log(username)
